# Random Password Generator

This **Random Password Generator** is a Python-based application designed to generate secure, random passwords based on user-defined criteria. It offers both a **command-line** version (basic) and an enhanced **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** version built with Tkinter.

##  Features

###  Basic Functionality (Command-Line Logic Behind the GUI)

* Generate random passwords of customizable length.
* Choose to include:

  * Uppercase letters
  * Lowercase letters
  * Digits
  * Symbols
* Exclude similar/confusing characters like `I`, `l`, `1`, `O`, `0`.
* Exclude custom characters entered by the user.

###  Advanced Functionality (GUI-Based)

* User-friendly GUI built using **Tkinter**.
* Select password length and complexity through checkboxes and input fields.
* **Password Strength Meter** that evaluates password quality.
* **Copy to Clipboard** with a single click.
* **Save Password to File** with timestamped entries.
* Customization of character exclusions for enhanced password control.

##  Key Concepts & Challenges Addressed

 Concept                    Description                                                         
 -------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------------------- 
  Randomization         -  Randomly generates secure passwords using Python's `random` module. 
  Input Validation      -  Ensures password length and character selections are valid.        
  Character Set Handling - Dynamically builds the character pool based on user preferences.    
  GUI Design             - Clean, intuitive interface using **Tkinter** widgets.               
  Security Rules         - Password strength scoring based on composition and length.          
  Clipboard Integration  - Seamlessly copies password using the `pyperclip` module.            
  Customization           -Advanced settings for excluding confusing or unwanted characters.   


##  Requirements

* Python 3.x
* Tkinter (comes pre-installed with Python)
* `pyperclip`
  Install using:

  ```bash
  pip install pyperclip
  ```



##  Future Improvements

* Add support for password categories (e.g., banking, social).
* Add option to show/hide password while typing.
* Implement encryption for saved passwords.
* Add theme customization and export/import settings.
